learning GIT

I enjoy learning new things.  I am exciting about understanding GIT and learning to collaborate.  

This inspires me to search AMAZON.com and see if anything has been written to understand collaboration in more detail.

I think my marriage should have to execute GIT.   Especially being the parents of twins.
