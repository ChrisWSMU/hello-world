learning GIT

I enjoy learning new things.  I am exciting about understanding GIT and learning to collaborate.  

This inspires me to search AMAZON.com and see if anything has been written to understand collaboration in more detail.

I think my marriage should have to execute GITHUB.   Especially being the parents of twins.

I found two books on AMAZON regarding collaborating 1) The ABC's of Research (Ben Shneiderman 2016) and 2)  A Crude Look at The Whole (John Miller 2016).
