# hello-world

I'm learning GIT.   I'm looking forward to becoming proficient at GITHUB and collaborating.

I'm inspired to look up collaborating on amazon.com and see if any research has been done on optimizing collaborating.

Perhaps my wife and I should become proficient on GITHUB.  Maybe it would make us better at parenting twins.
